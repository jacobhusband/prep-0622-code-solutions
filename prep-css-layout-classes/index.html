            globe-trotting archaeologist vying with Nazi German forces in 1936
            to recover the long-lost Ark of the Covenant, a relic said to make
            an army invincible. Teaming up with his tough former lover Marion
            Ravenwood (Allen), Jones races to stop rival archaeologist Dr. Ren√©
            Belloq (Freeman) from guiding the Nazis to the Ark and its power.
